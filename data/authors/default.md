Hi! I'm Daniel Blessing.

I'm a blockhain engineer and a data scientist. I graduated the University of San Francisco with a master's degree in data science, and graduated Johns Hopkins University with a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Chemical Engineering. I'm currently working as a blockchain engineer at a startup in San Francisco.

I'm currently working on Hackjack, a decentralized blackjack game built on the Ethereum blockchain.

I believe in the power of blockchains to change the world. They will do to money what the internet did to information, and the Gutenberg press did to books. I'm excited to be a part of this revolution.

Outside of work, I enjoy skiing, reading, and playing video games.
