Hardhat is a popular Ethereum development environment designed to streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying smart contracts. It provides developers with a range of tools, such as task automation, debugging, and network management, to create a more efficient workflow. However, repeatedly typing out long Hardhat commands can be cumbersome and time-consuming. In this post, I'll show you how to shorten your Hardhat commands using a simple alias and bash script, making your development experience even more seamless and enjoyable.

## Step 1: Create a bash script

First, create a new file called `hh.sh` in your home directory. You can use any text editor or the terminal to create the file. Then, add the following content to the file:

```bash:hh.sh
#!/bin/bash

if [[ $# -eq 2 ]]; then
  npx hardhat run --network $1 $2
elif [[ $# -eq 1 ]]; then
  npx hardhat run $1
else
  echo "Usage: hh.sh [network] [script]"
fi
```

Make the script executable with:

```terminal
chmod +x ~/hh.sh
```

## Step 2: Add an alias

Next, add an alias to your `.bashrc` file. Open the file with your favorite text editor and add the following line:

```bash:.bashrc
alias hh='bash ~/hh.sh'
```

## Step 3: Test it out

Now that you've created the alias, test it by running the following command:

```terminal
hh scripts/deploy.js
```

You can also add an optional network argument to the command:

```terminal
hh sepolia scripts/deploy.js
```

Congratulations, you've successfully created an alias to make running Hardhat commands easier! You can customize the alias to fit your workflow by modifying the `hh.sh` script.
